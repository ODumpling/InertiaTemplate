# InertiaTemplate

---

The InertiaTemplate is a template for [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) with [.NET8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), [React](https://react.dev) and [.Net Inertia Adapter](https://github.com/kapi2289/InertiaCore).
              
Please note no design decisions have been made e.g. DDD, CQRS, etc. This is a template to get you started with Inertia.js and .NET 8. You will need to do a little more work for that üòâ.

If you find this project useful, please give it a star. Thanks! ‚≠ê
